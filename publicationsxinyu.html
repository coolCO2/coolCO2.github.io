										<h2>Purified meta-Cresol Purple dye perturbation: How it influences spectrophotometric power of hydrogen measurements</h2> <b>Journal:</b> Marine Chemistry (2020)<p>

									<p>Ocean acidification, a phenomenon of seawater pH decreasing due to increasing atmospheric CO₂, has a global effect on seawater chemistry, marine biology, and ecosystems. Ocean acidification is a gradual and global long-term process, the study of which demands high-quality pH data. The spectrophotometric technique is capable of generating accurate and precise pH measurements but requires adding an indicator dye that perturbs the sample original pH. While the perturbation is modest in well-buffered seawater, applications of the method in environments with lower buffer capacity such as riverine, estuarine, sea-ice meltwater and lacustrine environments are increasingly common, and uncertainties related to larger potential dye perturbations need further evaluation. In this paper, we assess the effect of purified meta-Cresol Purple (mCP) dye addition on the sample pH and how to correct for this dye perturbation. We conducted numerical simulations by incorporating mCP speciation into the MATLAB CO2SYS program to examine the changes in water sample pH caused by the dye addition and to reveal the dye perturbation mechanisms. Then, laboratory experiments were carried out to verify the simulation results. The simulations suggest that the dye perturbation on sample pH is a result of total alkalinity (TA) contributions from the indicator dye and chemical equilibrium shifts that are related to both the water sample properties (pH, TA, and salinity) and the indicator dye solution properties (pH and solvent matrix). The laboratory experiments supported the simulation results; the same dye solution can lead to different dye perturbations in water samples with different pH, TA, and salinity values. The modeled adjustments agreed well with the empirically determined adjustments for salinities >5, but it showed greater errors for lower salinities with disagreements as large as 0.005 pH units. Adjustments are minimized when the pH and salinity of the dye are matched to the sample. When the dye is used over a wide range of salinity, we suggest that it should be prepared in deionized water to minimize the dye perturbation effect on pH in the fresher sample waters with less well-constrained perturbation adjustments. We also suggest that the dye perturbation correction should be based on double dye addition experiments performed over a wide range of pH, TA, and salinity. Otherwise, multiple volume dye addition experiments are recommended for each sample to determine the dye perturbation adjustment. We further create a MATLAB function dyeperturbation.m that calculates the expected dye perturbation. This function can be used to validate empirically-derived adjustments or in lieu of empirical adjustments if dye addition experiments are unfeasible (e.g., for historical data). This study of dye perturbation evaluation and correction will improve the accuracy of the pH data, necessary for monitoring the long-term anthropogenic-driven changes in the seawater carbonate system. </p>

										<h2>Impacts of human activities on nutrient transport in the Yellow River: The role of the Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme</h2> <b>Journal:</b> Science of the Total Environment (2017) <p>
									</header>
									<center><a class="image fit"><img style="max-width:600px; height: auto; " src="images/publicationxinyu_2.jpg"  alt="" /></a> </center>
									<p>Anthropogenic activities alter the natural states of large rivers and their surrounding environment. The Yellow River is a well-studied case of a large river with heavy human control. An artificial managed water and sediment release system, known as the Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS), has been carried out annually in the Yellow River since 2002. Nutrient concentrations and composition display significant time and space variations during the WSRS period. To figure out the anthropogenic impact of nutrient changes and transport in the Yellow River, biogeochemical observations were carried out in both middle reaches and lower reaches of the Yellow River during 2014 WSRS period. WSRS has a direct impact on water oxidation-reduction environment in the middle reaches; concentrations of nitrite (NO₂⁻) and ammonium (NH₄⁺) increased, while nitrate (NO₃⁻) concentration decreased by enhanced denitrification. WSRS changed transport of water and sediment; dissolved silicate (DSi) in the middle reaches was directly controlled by sediments release during the WSRS while in the lower reaches, DSi changed with both sediments and water released from middle reaches. During the WSRS, the differences of nutrient fluxes and concentrations between lower reaches and middle reaches were significant; dissolved inorganic phosphorous (DIP) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were higher in low reaches because of anthropogenic inputs. Human intervention, especially WSRS, can apparently change the natural states of both the mainstream and estuarine environments of the Yellow River within a short time.</p>

										<h2>Chesapeake Bay acidification buffered by spatially decoupled carbonate mineral cycling</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/chesapeakepub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere has acidified the ocean and threatened the health of marine
organisms and their ecosystems. In coastal waters, acidification is often enhanced by CO2 and acids produced under high rates
of biological respiration. However, less is known about buffering processes that counter coastal acidification in eutrophic
and seasonally hypoxic water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay. Here, we use carbonate chemistry, mineralogical analyses
and geochemical modelling to demonstrate the occurrence of a bay-wide pH-buffering mechanism resulting from spatially
decoupled calcium carbonate mineral cycling. In summer, high rates of photosynthesis by dense submerged aquatic vegetation
at the head of the bay and in shallow, nearshore areas generate high pH, an elevated carbonate mineral saturation state and net
alkalinity uptake. Calcium carbonate particles produced under these conditions are subsequently transported downstream into
corrosive subsurface waters, where their dissolution buffers pH decreases caused by aerobic respiration and anthropogenic CO2.
Because this pH-buffering mechanism would be strengthened by further nutrient load reductions and associated submerged
aquatic vegetation recovery, our findings suggest that the reduction of nutrient inputs into coastal waters will not only reduce
eutrophication and hypoxia, but also alleviate the severity of coastal ocean acidification.</p>

										<h2>Sea-ice loss amplifies summertime decadal CO2 increase in the western Arctic Ocean</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/seaicelosspub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Rapid climate warming and sea-ice loss have induced major changes in the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). However, the long-term trends in the western Arctic Ocean are unknown. Here we show that in 1994–2017, summer pCO2
in the Canada Basin increased at twice the rate of atmospheric increase. Warming and ice loss in the basin have strengthened the pCO2 seasonal amplitude, resulting in the rapid decadal increase. Consequently, the summer air–sea CO2 gradient has reduced rapidly,
and may become near zero within two decades. In contrast, there was no significant pCO2 increase on the Chukchi Shelf, where strong and increasing biological uptake has held pCO2 low, and thus the CO2 sink has increased and may increase further due to the atmospheric CO2 increase. Our findings elucidate the contrasting physical and biological drivers controlling sea surface
pCO2 variations and trends in response to climate change in the Arctic Ocean. </p>
