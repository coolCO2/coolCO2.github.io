										<h2>The carbonate system of the northern South China Sea: Seasonality and exchange with the western North Pacific</h2> <b>Journal:</b> Progress in Oceanography (2021)<p>
									</header>

									<p>Using the most comprehensive, high quality, high-resolution dataset for any marginal sea up to depths >2000 db, we examined the seasonality of the carbonate system in the northern South China Sea (nSCS) and exchange with the West Philippine Sea (WPS) during 2009–2011. The carbonate system dynamics demonstrated evident spatial and seasonal variations. Winter exhibited the highest average surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations (1936 ± 15 μmol kg<sup>−1</sup>), and summer had the lowest (1882 ± 12 μmol kg<sup>−1</sup>), primarily associated with more abundant freshwater inputs in summer. At 100 db depth, decreased DIC and total alkalinity (TA) values were observed within the Luzon Strait vicinity due to the influence of WPS waters. Higher DIC and TA concentrations were found within the central nSCS basin. The average Kuroshio contribution to the DIC inventory in the upper 150 db was seasonally significant, ranging between 11 and 32%, with the highest contributions during spring and winter. Below 2000 db, nSCS basin-averaged DIC was significantly higher than WPS-averaged DIC (∼23 µmol kg<sup>−1</sup> difference) due to more organic matter decomposition in the nSCS basin. Within the basin, average deep water DIC values were highest in autumn, and averaged concentrations at >18.5°N were lower than at ≤18.5°N. Our datasets and analysis imply that (i) the significant seasonal and spatial patterns of carbonate chemistry in the nSCS are controlled by a combination of large-scale and smaller mesoscale physical processes; (ii) extrinsically from Asian monsoons via seasonal freshwater discharge and dynamic exchanges with open ocean waters; and (iii) intrinsically, through seasonal vertical mixing as well as mesoscale processes and their subsequent new productions. The seasonal and spatial variability in carbonate parameters established here serves as an essential baseline to monitor future changes to the nSCS and to compare with other marginal sea systems. </p>

										<h2>Dynamics of dissolved inorganic carbon in the South China Sea: A modeling study</h2> <b>Journal:</b> Progress in Oceanography (2020; as coauthor) <p>
									</header>
									<center><a class="image fit"><img style="max-width:600px; height: auto; " src="images/publicationxinyu_2.jpg"  alt="" /></a> </center>
									<p>Using a validated, three-dimensional, coupled physical-biogeochemical model, this study examines the dynamics of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the South China Sea (SCS). The model identifies characteristic differences in DIC concentrations between the SCS and adjacent West Philippine Sea (WPS), showing an increase in DIC of up to 140 μmol kg−1 in the upper 2000 m layer from the WPS to the vicinity of the northern SCS. This increasing pattern continues from the northern to the southern SCS, but to a much lower degree (< 20 μmol kg−1 increase). Overall, spatial and seasonal variation of DIC in the SCS are evidently modulated by both intrinsic dynamics (e.g., river plumes, vertical mixing, basin-scale upwelling and eddies), and extrinsic exchanges via various straits. The inputs of DIC to the SCS are mainly through the Luzon Strait in the upper layer (depth, h < 600 m) and from the deep WPS at > 1600 m. Exports of DIC occur through other straits and the SCS intermediate water outflow (600 m to 1600 m) via the Luzon Strait. The model shows upward transport of DIC in the upper 400 m and below 1100 m, in contrast to downward DIC transport between 400 m and 1100 m. Seasonally, both DIC concentrations and fluxes in the upper layer have larger dynamic ranges in winter than in summer, attributable to the combined effects of enhanced Kuroshio intrusion, stronger vertical upwelling and greater biogeochemical alterations.

A balance of various constitutive DIC terms revealed that horizontal and vertical advection is an order of magnitude greater than the other terms of the DIC budget, which has an opposite sign and thus tends to neutralize each other. The model indicated a decrease in the DIC inventory in the euphotic zone in spring and summer caused by net DIC consumption, and a contrasting increase in fall and winter primarily influenced by DIC vertical transport. In intermediate and deep layers, physical transport processes play a dominant role in the seasonal variation of DIC inventories. In the upper 150 m, DIC fluxes and their stoichiometry with nutrient fluxes, which potentially impact the air-sea CO2 fluxes, are largely driven by excess vertical DIC fluxes compared to horizontal fluxes via the Luzon Strait.</p>

										<h2>Chesapeake Bay acidification buffered by spatially decoupled carbonate mineral cycling</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/chesapeakepub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere has acidified the ocean and threatened the health of marine
organisms and their ecosystems. In coastal waters, acidification is often enhanced by CO2 and acids produced under high rates
of biological respiration. However, less is known about buffering processes that counter coastal acidification in eutrophic
and seasonally hypoxic water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay. Here, we use carbonate chemistry, mineralogical analyses
and geochemical modelling to demonstrate the occurrence of a bay-wide pH-buffering mechanism resulting from spatially
decoupled calcium carbonate mineral cycling. In summer, high rates of photosynthesis by dense submerged aquatic vegetation
at the head of the bay and in shallow, nearshore areas generate high pH, an elevated carbonate mineral saturation state and net
alkalinity uptake. Calcium carbonate particles produced under these conditions are subsequently transported downstream into
corrosive subsurface waters, where their dissolution buffers pH decreases caused by aerobic respiration and anthropogenic CO2.
Because this pH-buffering mechanism would be strengthened by further nutrient load reductions and associated submerged
aquatic vegetation recovery, our findings suggest that the reduction of nutrient inputs into coastal waters will not only reduce
eutrophication and hypoxia, but also alleviate the severity of coastal ocean acidification.</p>

										<h2>Sea-ice loss amplifies summertime decadal CO2 increase in the western Arctic Ocean</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/seaicelosspub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Rapid climate warming and sea-ice loss have induced major changes in the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). However, the long-term trends in the western Arctic Ocean are unknown. Here we show that in 1994–2017, summer pCO2
in the Canada Basin increased at twice the rate of atmospheric increase. Warming and ice loss in the basin have strengthened the pCO2 seasonal amplitude, resulting in the rapid decadal increase. Consequently, the summer air–sea CO2 gradient has reduced rapidly,
and may become near zero within two decades. In contrast, there was no significant pCO2 increase on the Chukchi Shelf, where strong and increasing biological uptake has held pCO2 low, and thus the CO2 sink has increased and may increase further due to the atmospheric CO2 increase. Our findings elucidate the contrasting physical and biological drivers controlling sea surface
pCO2 variations and trends in response to climate change in the Arctic Ocean. </p>
