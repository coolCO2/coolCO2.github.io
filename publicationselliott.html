										<h2>The carbonate system of the northern South China Sea: Seasonality and exchange with the western North Pacific</h2> <b>Journal:</b> Progress in Oceanography (2021)<p>
									</header>

									<p>Using the most comprehensive, high quality, high-resolution dataset for any marginal sea up to depths >2000 db, we examined the seasonality of the carbonate system in the northern South China Sea (nSCS) and exchange with the West Philippine Sea (WPS) during 2009–2011. The carbonate system dynamics demonstrated evident spatial and seasonal variations. Winter exhibited the highest average surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations (1936 ± 15 μmol kg<sup>−1</sup>), and summer had the lowest (1882 ± 12 μmol kg<sup>−1</sup>), primarily associated with more abundant freshwater inputs in summer. At 100 db depth, decreased DIC and total alkalinity (TA) values were observed within the Luzon Strait vicinity due to the influence of WPS waters. Higher DIC and TA concentrations were found within the central nSCS basin. The average Kuroshio contribution to the DIC inventory in the upper 150 db was seasonally significant, ranging between 11 and 32%, with the highest contributions during spring and winter. Below 2000 db, nSCS basin-averaged DIC was significantly higher than WPS-averaged DIC (∼23 µmol kg<sup>−1</sup> difference) due to more organic matter decomposition in the nSCS basin. Within the basin, average deep water DIC values were highest in autumn, and averaged concentrations at >18.5°N were lower than at ≤18.5°N. Our datasets and analysis imply that (i) the significant seasonal and spatial patterns of carbonate chemistry in the nSCS are controlled by a combination of large-scale and smaller mesoscale physical processes; (ii) extrinsically from Asian monsoons via seasonal freshwater discharge and dynamic exchanges with open ocean waters; and (iii) intrinsically, through seasonal vertical mixing as well as mesoscale processes and their subsequent new productions. The seasonal and spatial variability in carbonate parameters established here serves as an essential baseline to monitor future changes to the nSCS and to compare with other marginal sea systems. </p>

										<h2>Impacts of human activities on nutrient transport in the Yellow River: The role of the Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme</h2> <b>Journal:</b> Science of the Total Environment (2017) <p>
									</header>
									<center><a class="image fit"><img style="max-width:600px; height: auto; " src="images/publicationxinyu_2.jpg"  alt="" /></a> </center>
									<p>Anthropogenic activities alter the natural states of large rivers and their surrounding environment. The Yellow River is a well-studied case of a large river with heavy human control. An artificial managed water and sediment release system, known as the Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS), has been carried out annually in the Yellow River since 2002. Nutrient concentrations and composition display significant time and space variations during the WSRS period. To figure out the anthropogenic impact of nutrient changes and transport in the Yellow River, biogeochemical observations were carried out in both middle reaches and lower reaches of the Yellow River during 2014 WSRS period. WSRS has a direct impact on water oxidation-reduction environment in the middle reaches; concentrations of nitrite (NO2(-)) and ammonium (NH4(+)) increased, while nitrate (NO3(-)) concentration decreased by enhanced denitrification. WSRS changed transport of water and sediment; dissolved silicate (DSi) in the middle reaches was directly controlled by sediments release during the WSRS while in the lower reaches, DSi changed with both sediments and water released from middle reaches. During the WSRS, the differences of nutrient fluxes and concentrations between lower reaches and middle reaches were significant; dissolved inorganic phosphorous (DIP) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were higher in low reaches because of anthropogenic inputs. Human intervention, especially WSRS, can apparently change the natural states of both the mainstream and estuarine environments of the Yellow River within a short time.</p>

										<h2>Chesapeake Bay acidification buffered by spatially decoupled carbonate mineral cycling</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/chesapeakepub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere has acidified the ocean and threatened the health of marine
organisms and their ecosystems. In coastal waters, acidification is often enhanced by CO2 and acids produced under high rates
of biological respiration. However, less is known about buffering processes that counter coastal acidification in eutrophic
and seasonally hypoxic water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay. Here, we use carbonate chemistry, mineralogical analyses
and geochemical modelling to demonstrate the occurrence of a bay-wide pH-buffering mechanism resulting from spatially
decoupled calcium carbonate mineral cycling. In summer, high rates of photosynthesis by dense submerged aquatic vegetation
at the head of the bay and in shallow, nearshore areas generate high pH, an elevated carbonate mineral saturation state and net
alkalinity uptake. Calcium carbonate particles produced under these conditions are subsequently transported downstream into
corrosive subsurface waters, where their dissolution buffers pH decreases caused by aerobic respiration and anthropogenic CO2.
Because this pH-buffering mechanism would be strengthened by further nutrient load reductions and associated submerged
aquatic vegetation recovery, our findings suggest that the reduction of nutrient inputs into coastal waters will not only reduce
eutrophication and hypoxia, but also alleviate the severity of coastal ocean acidification.</p>

										<h2>Sea-ice loss amplifies summertime decadal CO2 increase in the western Arctic Ocean</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/seaicelosspub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Rapid climate warming and sea-ice loss have induced major changes in the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). However, the long-term trends in the western Arctic Ocean are unknown. Here we show that in 1994–2017, summer pCO2
in the Canada Basin increased at twice the rate of atmospheric increase. Warming and ice loss in the basin have strengthened the pCO2 seasonal amplitude, resulting in the rapid decadal increase. Consequently, the summer air–sea CO2 gradient has reduced rapidly,
and may become near zero within two decades. In contrast, there was no significant pCO2 increase on the Chukchi Shelf, where strong and increasing biological uptake has held pCO2 low, and thus the CO2 sink has increased and may increase further due to the atmospheric CO2 increase. Our findings elucidate the contrasting physical and biological drivers controlling sea surface
pCO2 variations and trends in response to climate change in the Arctic Ocean. </p>
