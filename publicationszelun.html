										<h2>Revisiting the Intraseasonal Variability of Chlorophyll-a in the Adjacent Luzon Strait With a New Gap-Filled Remote Sensing Data Set</h2><b>Journal:</b> IEEE TGRS (2021; as coauthor) <p>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/publicationzelun.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In the northern South China Sea of western Pacific Ocean during winter, clouds, sun glint, and other factors block optic sensors, leading to a high missing rate and hence a major concern in ocean color products such as the chlorophyll-a (CHL) data. These constraints inhibit the understanding of CHL variabilities at short (< seasonal) scales. Here we introduce a new gap-filling method to reconstruct data gaps in a daily CHL remote sensing product. We applied discrete cosine transform with penalized least square (DCT PLS) approach in the adjacent Luzon Strait, yielding a 15-year full-coverage daily 4-km CHL product. Against the cross-validation set and an independent observational dataset collected from 34 cruises, evaluations suggest that DCT PLS has outperformed the widely applied classical data-interpolating empirical orthogonal function (DINEOF) method. Besides, the DCT PLS method is characterized by more efficient computation. The complete CHL product was analyzed with a particular focus on the intraseasonal (~30-60 days) control on the winter bloom by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The MJO’s local signature on the CHL presents asymmetry. The CHL peaks at the late phases of MJO events, which could be explained by the relaxation after the MJO-induced wind strengthening. This gap-filling approach can be promisingly applied in other remote sensing gap-filling problems, which could shed light on the short-term variability of biological and physical dynamics in the ocean.</p>

										<h2>Controls on surface water carbonate chemistry along North American ocean margins</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/controlspub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Syntheses of carbonate chemistry spatial patterns are important for predicting ocean acidification impacts, but are lacking in coastal oceans. Here, we show that along the North
American Atlantic and Gulf coasts the meridional distributions of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and carbonate mineral saturation state (Ω) are controlled by partial equilibrium with the atmosphere resulting in relatively low DIC and high Ω in warm southern waters and the
opposite in cold northern waters. However, pH and the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) do not exhibit a simple spatial pattern and are controlled by local physical and net biological processes which impede equilibrium with the atmosphere. Along the Pacific coast, upwelling
brings subsurface waters with low Ω and pH to the surface where net biological production works to raise their values. Different temperature sensitivities of carbonate properties and different timescales of influencing processes lead to contrasting property distributions within
and among margins.</p>

										<h2>Chesapeake Bay acidification buffered by spatially decoupled carbonate mineral cycling</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/chesapeakepub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere has acidified the ocean and threatened the health of marine
organisms and their ecosystems. In coastal waters, acidification is often enhanced by CO2 and acids produced under high rates
of biological respiration. However, less is known about buffering processes that counter coastal acidification in eutrophic
and seasonally hypoxic water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay. Here, we use carbonate chemistry, mineralogical analyses
and geochemical modelling to demonstrate the occurrence of a bay-wide pH-buffering mechanism resulting from spatially
decoupled calcium carbonate mineral cycling. In summer, high rates of photosynthesis by dense submerged aquatic vegetation
at the head of the bay and in shallow, nearshore areas generate high pH, an elevated carbonate mineral saturation state and net
alkalinity uptake. Calcium carbonate particles produced under these conditions are subsequently transported downstream into
corrosive subsurface waters, where their dissolution buffers pH decreases caused by aerobic respiration and anthropogenic CO2.
Because this pH-buffering mechanism would be strengthened by further nutrient load reductions and associated submerged
aquatic vegetation recovery, our findings suggest that the reduction of nutrient inputs into coastal waters will not only reduce
eutrophication and hypoxia, but also alleviate the severity of coastal ocean acidification.</p>

										<h2>Sea-ice loss amplifies summertime decadal CO2 increase in the western Arctic Ocean</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/seaicelosspub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Rapid climate warming and sea-ice loss have induced major changes in the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). However, the long-term trends in the western Arctic Ocean are unknown. Here we show that in 1994–2017, summer pCO2
in the Canada Basin increased at twice the rate of atmospheric increase. Warming and ice loss in the basin have strengthened the pCO2 seasonal amplitude, resulting in the rapid decadal increase. Consequently, the summer air–sea CO2 gradient has reduced rapidly,
and may become near zero within two decades. In contrast, there was no significant pCO2 increase on the Chukchi Shelf, where strong and increasing biological uptake has held pCO2 low, and thus the CO2 sink has increased and may increase further due to the atmospheric CO2 increase. Our findings elucidate the contrasting physical and biological drivers controlling sea surface
pCO2 variations and trends in response to climate change in the Arctic Ocean. </p>
