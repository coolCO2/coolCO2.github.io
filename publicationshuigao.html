										<h2>Spatio-Temporal Variations of Winter Phytoplankton Blooms Northwest of the Luzon Island in the South China Sea</h2> <b>Journal:</b> Frontiers in Marine Science (2021)<p>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/publicationhuigao1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Phytoplankton is a key component of marine ecosystems. Winter phytoplankton blooms are frequently observed northwest of Luzon Island in the South China Sea. In this study, with the multi-satellite merged ocean color remote sensing data from November 1999 to February 2015, we examine the spatial and temporal changes of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and further investigate its response to physical environment parameters including wind speed, Ekman transport, Ekman pumping velocity, sea surface temperature, and sea level anomalies in the region northwest of Luzon Island. The main factors affecting the distribution of Chl-a are discussed by using the partial correlation analysis and multiple stepwise linear regression analysis. The results show that centers of winter Chl-a blooms northwest of Luzon Island often occur near 119.5°E, 19.5°N. The significant multiple correlation (r = 0.76, p < 0.01) between Chl-a and oceanic conditions indicates that both the wind component parallel to the coastline and the wind stress curls enhance the winter upwelling in the study area, consistent with previous studies. A novel finding in the present study is that the winter bloom center is located north of the upwelling center, attributed to the advection effect of the northward background coastal flow. </p>

										<h2>Controls on surface water carbonate chemistry along North American ocean margins</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/controlspub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Syntheses of carbonate chemistry spatial patterns are important for predicting ocean acidification impacts, but are lacking in coastal oceans. Here, we show that along the North
American Atlantic and Gulf coasts the meridional distributions of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and carbonate mineral saturation state (Ω) are controlled by partial equilibrium with the atmosphere resulting in relatively low DIC and high Ω in warm southern waters and the
opposite in cold northern waters. However, pH and the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) do not exhibit a simple spatial pattern and are controlled by local physical and net biological processes which impede equilibrium with the atmosphere. Along the Pacific coast, upwelling
brings subsurface waters with low Ω and pH to the surface where net biological production works to raise their values. Different temperature sensitivities of carbonate properties and different timescales of influencing processes lead to contrasting property distributions within
and among margins.</p>

										<h2>Chesapeake Bay acidification buffered by spatially decoupled carbonate mineral cycling</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/chesapeakepub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere has acidified the ocean and threatened the health of marine
organisms and their ecosystems. In coastal waters, acidification is often enhanced by CO2 and acids produced under high rates
of biological respiration. However, less is known about buffering processes that counter coastal acidification in eutrophic
and seasonally hypoxic water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay. Here, we use carbonate chemistry, mineralogical analyses
and geochemical modelling to demonstrate the occurrence of a bay-wide pH-buffering mechanism resulting from spatially
decoupled calcium carbonate mineral cycling. In summer, high rates of photosynthesis by dense submerged aquatic vegetation
at the head of the bay and in shallow, nearshore areas generate high pH, an elevated carbonate mineral saturation state and net
alkalinity uptake. Calcium carbonate particles produced under these conditions are subsequently transported downstream into
corrosive subsurface waters, where their dissolution buffers pH decreases caused by aerobic respiration and anthropogenic CO2.
Because this pH-buffering mechanism would be strengthened by further nutrient load reductions and associated submerged
aquatic vegetation recovery, our findings suggest that the reduction of nutrient inputs into coastal waters will not only reduce
eutrophication and hypoxia, but also alleviate the severity of coastal ocean acidification.</p>

										<h2>Sea-ice loss amplifies summertime decadal CO2 increase in the western Arctic Ocean</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/seaicelosspub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Rapid climate warming and sea-ice loss have induced major changes in the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). However, the long-term trends in the western Arctic Ocean are unknown. Here we show that in 1994–2017, summer pCO2
in the Canada Basin increased at twice the rate of atmospheric increase. Warming and ice loss in the basin have strengthened the pCO2 seasonal amplitude, resulting in the rapid decadal increase. Consequently, the summer air–sea CO2 gradient has reduced rapidly,
and may become near zero within two decades. In contrast, there was no significant pCO2 increase on the Chukchi Shelf, where strong and increasing biological uptake has held pCO2 low, and thus the CO2 sink has increased and may increase further due to the atmospheric CO2 increase. Our findings elucidate the contrasting physical and biological drivers controlling sea surface
pCO2 variations and trends in response to climate change in the Arctic Ocean. </p>
